function add_learning!(system::System, model::Model)
    ```
    Builds endogenous technological learning formulation. The main purpose is to formulate the endogenous investment cost, called "annualized_investment_cost_with_learning", which is used in edge.jl for any learning technologies

    Inputs:
    Takes a system input because we need to combine new_capacity across edges of the same "learning_type" attribute to determine the amount of learning for a given technology. e.g., solar costs depend on total capacity expansion across all solar edges.
